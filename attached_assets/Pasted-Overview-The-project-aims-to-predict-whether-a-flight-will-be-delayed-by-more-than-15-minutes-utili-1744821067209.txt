Overview
The project aims to predict whether a flight will be delayed by more than 15 minutes, utilizing data available two hours prior to departure. By integrating historical flight and weather data, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist stakeholders in anticipating and managing flight delays.

Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Flight Data: Sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation, encompassing data from 2015 to 2019, including 371 origin airports, 369 destination airports, 19 airlines, and 7,894 unique tail numbers.​

Weather Data: Obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), focusing on conditions such as thunderstorms, ice, snow, and fog.​

Data Cleaning: Involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, converting times to UTC, and filtering for flights within the continental U.S.​

Feature Engineering
Weather Features: One-hot encoding of adverse weather conditions at 2 and 4 hours before departure, retaining the most severe condition in each time window.​

Flight Features:

Origin-Destination (O-D) Pairs: Identification of unique route combinations.​

PageRank: Assessment of airport importance within the network.​

Delay Graph: Construction of a graph with airports as nodes and median delays as edge weights, capturing outbound and inbound delays.​

Delay States: Clustering of network-wide delay patterns using K-means to define delay states at 2 and 4 hours before departure.​

Flight Chain Features: Analysis of an aircraft's previous five flights to assess cumulative delay impact.​

Data Integration
The cleaned and engineered flight and weather datasets were merged to form a comprehensive dataset for modeling.​

Results
Model Development
Model Architecture: A stacked model comprising a weighted Random Forest Classifier and a Logistic Regression model.​

Feature Selection:

Categorical Variables: Selected using decision trees.​

Continuous Variables: Reduced dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), retaining 13 components explaining over 95% of variance.​

Model Optimization: Implemented a custom time-series aware cross-validation to preserve temporal dependencies during hyperparameter tuning.​

Discussions
The integration of network-based features, such as delay graphs and flight chains, significantly enhanced the model's predictive capabilities. The use of PCA facilitated the identification of key continuous variables, while the custom cross-validation approach ensured the model's robustness over time.​

Challenges
Data Quality: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of flight and weather data, particularly in handling missing or inconsistent entries.​

Temporal Dependencies: Standard cross-validation techniques were inadequate for time-series data, necessitating the development of a custom validation approach.​

Feature Complexity: Engineering features that accurately capture the dynamic nature of flight delays without introducing multicollinearity.​

Future Work
Real-Time Implementation: Transitioning the model to operate in real-time environments for proactive delay management.​

Expanded Feature Set: Incorporating additional variables such as air traffic control data, maintenance schedules, and passenger load factors.​

Model Generalization: Testing the model's applicability across different regions and time frames to assess its generalizability.
